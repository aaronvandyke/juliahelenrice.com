						This statement recognizes the traditional owners of the land on which this research occurred.<i> Mni Sóta
							Makoce</i> (Minnesota) is the homeland of the Dakota. The Anishinaabe made Minnesota their home after
						following the guidance of the<i> Gete-anishinaabeg</i> and<i> Aadizookaanag</i> to the<i> manoomin</i> (wild
						rice). Many other Indigenous people from other Tribal nations have made Minnesota their home and contributed
						to its history. Harvard University, which provided funding for this research, occupies land within the
						traditional homeland of the Massachusetts. This atlas aims to remember and honor the history and people of
						these lands.

						After 52 years of service, Minneapolis’ Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam was permanently closed to
						riverine traffic in 2015. St. Anthony Falls, the only major waterfall on the Mississippi, has long been
						central to the history, culture, economy, and ecology of the river, the city, and the region. This research
						project, using St. Anthony Falls as a focal point, investigated questions of ownership and agency along the
						falls, the Mississippi, and across the traditional Dakota homeland in the state that is now called
						Minnesota.
					</p>
					<p>
						Almost immediately after the closure of the USAF lock and dam in 2015, questions of ownership arose.
						Currently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is seeking to fully dispose of its ownership of the site, but
						state and local governments are working to keep the federal government on as partial owners. The complexity
						of the infrastructure at the lock along with the necessity of maintaining the lock have created a
						contentious debate over who should be responsible for the site and able to determine its future. Total
						removal of the lock would disrupt Minneapolis’ water supply as well as the ability of Xcel energy to
						continue producing hydroelectric power for 9,000 city residents.<sup>1</sup> But there is little desire
						among the city and state to pay for the upkeep and maintenance of the lock and dam.
					</p>
					<p>
						The debate over who should own the USAF lock site has been centered on current recognized property owners
						along the river and at St. Anthony Falls, but the question of ownership runs much deeper than
						post-industrial developers, governmental partnerships, and private enterprise. The City of Minneapolis and
						St. Anthony Falls are in the heart of the traditional homeland of the Dakota people. For the Dakota, St.
						Anthony Falls is known as Owámni and the Mississippi is Haháwakpa. The Dakota view the river as a living
						relative with agency to determine its future. This research hopes to center the debate about ownership
						within the river itself. What future does the river desire for the falls and for the people living along it?

						Today Owámni/St. Anthony Falls sits 8.5 miles upstream from the confluence of the Minnesota and the
						Mississippi Rivers. To the Dakota, this confluence is the center of the world. Known as Bdóte, it is where
						the world and the Dakota people begin.<sup>2</sup> This dynamic landscape, which the Dakota call Mni Sóta
						Makoce, has
						shifted and changed continuously for millennia. The glaciers, rivers, sandstone bedrock, and the falls have
						all moved and changed their forms as they encountered each other. The first form of Owámni/St. Anthony Falls
						occurred when Glacial Lake Agassiz and Glacial Lake Anoka broke through their ice dams and carved the
						channels of the ancestral Mississippi River and River Warren. 12,000 years ago, these two rivers tore
						through the soft bedrock and created the River Warren Falls near the sacred Wakán Tipi cave. Over the
						millennia the falls moved rapidly upstream at a rate of 4 feet per year to create the Owámni/St. Anthony
						Falls European colonists encountered in the 17th-century.<sup>3</sup>

						The underlying geology of the Upper Mississippi landscape has been the determining factor in the rapid
						upstream retreat of the falls. The bedrock, which has been carved out by the Mississippi River, is made up
						of layers of sedimentary rock deposited during the Cambrian and Ordovician periods (570-438 million years
						B.P.) St. Peter Sandstone is topped with a thin layer of shale and a thicker layer of Platteville Limestone.
						The limestone is more resistant to erosion than the shale and sandstone and controls the rate of erosion.
						When water finds fissures in the limestone though, it quickly erodes the underlying sandstone. Eventually
						huge chunks of limestone break away and the edge of the falls advances upstream.

						How to represent the dynamism of this landscape became the first challenge of the research. Traditional
						Euro-American mapping techniques of grids, property boundaries, and lines delineating land from water
						abstract the movement of glaciers, the erosion of soil, or the shifting course of a river. Drawings with
						ink, a water-based medium, were used to represent the movement of water in the landscape. By layering the
						ink drawings with open source GIS data and historical maps of the falls and Minnesota, new representations
						that capture the ever-changing landscape and the impacts of Euro-American colonization on Mni Sóta Makoce
						were created.
					</p>
					<p>
						The scale of the maps was chosen to show the approximate extent of the traditional Dakota homeland. The
						Dakota lived as far east as present day western Wisconsin, as far west as the eastern Dakotas, south down
						the Blue Earth River, and north into the lakes of northern Minnesota. But even this is too fixed a
						description - the boundaries of the territory occupied by the Dakota shifted continuously with changes in
						the seasons, shifts in vegetation and wildlife, and conflicts or alliances with other tribes.
					</p>
					<p>
						The current form of Owámni/St. Anthony Falls is the result of geophysical, climatic, anthropogenic, and
						hydrological processes. The story of how Owámni/St. Anthony Falls came to exist in its current form begins
						at the end of the last Ice Age. The drawing on the left represents Mni Sóta Makoce during the middle of the
						most recent Wisconsin Glaciation. The Superior Lobe of the glaciers was at its greatest extent approximately
						15,000 years B.P. This phase of glaciation created the massive St. Croix Moraine which stretches
						northwestward from Minneapolis/St. Paul to Little Falls, MN. As the glacier retreated the St. Croix and
						Mississippi Rivers were carved into the landscape by glacial meltwater.

						Advances and retreats of the glaciers continued for another 6,000 years after the full advance of the
						Superior Lobe. The Grantsburg Sublobe moved north and westward into Minnesota from the Des Moines Lobe,
						reaching its full extent around 13,500 years B.P. Outwash from the Grantsburg sublobe helped form Glacial
						Lake Anoka and altered the morphology of the Mississippi River valley by filling it with sand and gravel.
						Around 12,000 B.P. Lake Agassiz formed in the northern Minnesota and southern Canada. Meltwater from Lake
						Agassiz created the River Warren, which carved out the wide valley of the present Minnesota River. Numerous
						downcutting events occurred within the Mississippi Valley until roughly 10,800 years B.P. These events
						formed the present course of the Mississippi River and the current landscape of the Upper Mississippi
						corridor.<sup>7</sup>

						As the rivers and lakes of Mni Sóta Makoce developed, vegetation grew in the rich glacial and alluvial
						deposits in the uplands and along the valleys. For the Dakota, the landscape offered abundant resources. It
						was the meeting ground of multiple biomes: the prairies stretching west, the hardwood forests running east,
						and the coniferous forests of the north. The Dakota were nomadic and moved with the seasons as each biome
						offered different plants and wildlife to be harvested or hunted. From buffalo and prairie turnips in the
						west, to wild rice, fish and waterfowl in the north, to maple sap, berries, and deer in the east; the Dakota
						viewed the landscape as a living relative that provided for them as long as they followed its rhythms and
						honored its traditions.<sup>8</sup>
					</p>
					<p>
						The Dakota did not conceive of the landscape as an object to be bounded and defined. For them, tribal
						identity was defined through kinship networks with the land, water, and resources interwoven into the
						networks as kin.<sup>9</sup> Therefore, these maps do not attempt to draw clear boundaries between biomes or
						ecosystems traditionally inhabited by the Dakota.

						These maps do still utilize some of the conventions of Euro-American mapping traditions. For example, all
						the maps are oriented with north at the top of the page. This is not a universal convention: for the Dakota,
						south is the traditional cardinal direction for orientation and for the Anishinaabe it is east.<sup>10</sup>
						Additionally, lines were drawn to represent the rivers and the shorelines of lakes in the landscape, which
						creates the illusion of hard borders between diffuse qualities. The reason for this choice is to better
						visualize the network of rivers in Mni Sóta Makoce and their importance for transportation.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the Dakota, and other indigenous peoples, the dense network of rivers and streams provided easy routes
						through the landscape. For centuries, canoeing by river was the most efficient means of transporting goods
						and people – even after European contact, French fur traders rapidly adopted canoes as their preferred
						method of travel.<sup>11</sup>
					</p>
					<p>
						This map represents the major rivers and lakes the Dakota used to travel through Mni Sóta Makoce. The bodies
						of water are labeled with their Dakota and Anishinaabe names. The Anishinaabe first entered the landscape in
						the 16th-century and eventually came to settle around the Great Lakes, making contact with the Dakota in the
						18th-century.

						“My father’s grandfather said that before the earth was made there was water everywhere; no land was to be
						seen. The Great Power (Wakątąka) made the earth and then made man and woman. From them the Dakota were born.
						There was then no white man on the earth. After the Great Power had made the Dakota they had nothing to eat.
						They were told to procure various kinds of fish from the waters of the lakes, rivers and creeks…. The Great
						Power then made all those animals that have fur and swim in the water. These we were to eat…. He then made
						the wild animals that live on the land, causing them to be fit for food. This was the beginning of

						common on the western plains and wild rice was more common on the northern lakes; it was possible to access
						many of these food sources across the entire landscape. The Dakota knew the flora and fauna of Mni Sóta

						The people in Mni Sóta Makoce moved and adapted to the continuously changing landscape. European colonists
						did not encounter a static place and a static Dakota culture when they arrived in Mni Sóta Makoce. Nor did
						the Europeans remain unchanged from their experiences with the people, land, and rivers of Mni Sóta Makoce.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before the French, it was the Anishinaabe who arrived in Mni Sóta Makoce, fleeing the Iroquois and the
						English in the 17th-century. From the Great Lakes they moved into Dakota territory which created conflict
						between the two powerful nations.<sup>15</sup> In the 18th-century, the Dakota chose to cede some of their
						northern
						territory to the Anishinaabe and moved farther west. But to say that there were defined territories,
						borders, and agreements between the Dakota and the Anishinaabe is too simplistic. The Anishinaabe
						intermingled with the Dakota along a rough border zone. Even after the cession of some of their lands to the
						Anishinaabe, some Dakota chose to stay, particularly at Mde Wakan/Misi-zaaga’igan/Mille Lacs Lake, and
						intermarry with the Anishinaabe.<sup>16</sup>
					</p>
					<p>
						The map on this page represents the general borders of Dakota and Anishinaabe territory as well as major
						settlements of both cultures at the start the American Revolution. Instead of drawing a clear delineation
						between the territory of the Dakota and of the Anishinaabe, representations of both bleed into each other
						and intermingle.

						French fur traders started arriving in Mni Sóta Makoce in the middle of the 17th-century. The Dakota, who
						already knew about the white newcomers and the guns and goods they could provide, were eager to establish a
						trading relationship with the French.<sup>17</sup> The French were not seeking to settle the Upper
						Mississippi but
						instead hoped to develop a profitable trading economy. Both the Dakota and the French adapted to each other
						to establish a mutually beneficial relationship. French fur traders married into Dakota kinship networks,
						and the children of these marriages, the Métis, played a central role in supporting a hybrid culture that
						survived for close to two-hundred years after the French first arrived.<sup>18</sup>
					</p>
					<p>
						In contrast, after the Louisiana Purchase, the United States government considered Mni Sóta Makoce to be
						U.S. land and wanted to open it to settlement. In 1805 Zebulon Pike arrived at Bdóte on an expedition to
						establish U.S. Army outposts. Pike negotiated a treaty which granted the United States the right to
						establish forts and trading posts along the Mississippi between Bdóte and Owámni/St. Anthony Falls for
						$2,000. Crucially the treaty stipulated that the Dakota retained the right to use, hunt, and travel through
						the ceded land as they had always done.<sup>19</sup>

						In 1810 Pike published an account of his travels through the Mississippi watershed and the book included a
						map of Owámni/St. Anthony Falls. This is one of the oldest maps I was able to find of the falls. It shows
						the form of the falls before industrialization. At the time of colonization, there were five islands that
						existed near the edge of the falls and were well-known to the Dakota. Wita Wasté, which later became known
						as Nicollet Island, was often used as a place to give birth.<sup>20</sup> Spirit Island, considered sacred
						by the Dakota,
						was dotted with eagle’s nests who found the island perfect as a site for catching fish.<sup>21</sup>
					</p>
					<p>
						European accounts of the falls through the 17th to the 19th-centuries describe a sublime site. Father Louis
						Hennepin, who gave the falls its name of St. Anthony, estimated it plunged 40-60 feet in 1680. Other
						visitors likened the falls to Niagra and claimed its roar could be heard 15 miles away. The great limestone
						blocks that fell off the edge of the falls as it retreated littered the riverbed and multiplied the
						rapids.<sup>22</sup> Crucially, in his map, Pike has drawn the portage around the falls that Native and
						Euro-American people alike utilized to reach the Mississippi above the falls. This portage often functioned
						as a rest stop and gathering place for the Dakota and other visitors to the site.<sup>23</sup>

								It took another 15 years for the U.S. Army to establish Fort Snelling on the west bank of the
								Mississippi
								across from Bdóte. In the intervening years between Zebulon Pike’s expedition and the arrival of U.S.
								soldiers on the 1805 treaty land, American settlers had moved with amazing rapidity across the North
								American continent. By the 1830s, settlers were crowding at the edges of Dakota and Anishinaabe
								territory,
								eager to gain access to their land. In 1837 the Dakota and Anishinaabe were forced to give up their
								lands
								east of the Mississippi and south of the 46th parallel. The treaty included language which gave the
								Dakota
								and the Anishinaabe the right to hunt, harvest, and travel through the ceded land as they always had,
								but
								the U.S. government quickly persecuted any Native trespasses on the ceded land.<sup>24</sup>
							</p>
							<p>
								Additionally, the Prairie du Chien Treaty of 1830 established a “Half-Breed Tract” for the mixed-race
								relatives of the Dakota. The 25-mile by 32-mile tract stretched from Red Wing’s village to Wabasha’s
								village
								on Lake Pepin. The land was legally reserved for the mixed-race relatives of the Dakota in hopes that
								they
								would take up European farming methods. In reality, traders and speculators quickly took advantage of
								the
								newly defined land to stake claims for themselves or to sell.<sup>25</sup>

								Four years later, in 1851, the Dakota were forced to cede their lands west of the Mississippi except for
								a
								tract of land along the Minnesota River. Minnesota had received official territory designation in 1849
								and
								settlers were urging the U.S. government to open the lands to speculation. The Dakota had little choice
								in
								the matter; their lands were depleted of the game they hunted and white settlers were steadily taking
								over
								the landscape, with the tacit support of the U.S. government. The Dakota hoped the promised cash would
								allow
								the tribes to live and support themselves on the lands that remained.<sup>28</sup>
							</p>
							<p>
								In 1854 the “Half-Breed” Tract was opened up to speculation. Ostensibly, the plan by the U.S. government
								was
								to parcel off the land to eligible mixed-race claimants and provide them with scrip with which to redeem
								their claim. In reality, squatters illegally occupying the land forced the U.S. government to recognize
								their right to remain and land speculators illegally bought up large amounts of any scrip still owned by
								mixed-race claimants.<sup>29</sup> The lands of the “Half-Breed” Tract suffered the same result as all
								other
								lands occupied by Native peoples; the U.S. government enforced the theft of Dakota land by squatters and
								speculators instead of enforcing the legally binding treaties the federal government had negotiated.

								The speed and efficiency with which the U.S. government was able to acquire Native American land, survey
								it,
								and sell it to private individuals was due to the Public Land Survey System established by the Land
								Ordinance of 1785. The Public Land Survey System required surveyors to survey the landscape into
								36-mile-square townships using east-west running baselines and north-south running principal meridians.
								Those townships were further surveyed into 36 one-mile-square sections. From there any section could be
								broken down into half sections, quarter sections, half quarter sections, and quarter quarter sections.
								The
								square grid of the Public Land Survey System could be quickly measured out by a survey crew, mapped,
								advertised for sale, and sold to private individuals.<sup>30</sup> The lands that the U.S. government
								labeled “public”
								and available for survey and sale where always lands traditionally occupied by Indigenous people that
								had
								been taken from them by force or by manipulation.
							</p>
							<p>
								In 1853 the land around Owámni/St. Anthony Falls was surveyed after the 1851 cession of their lands west
								of
								the Mississippi by the Dakota. The original survey plat on the right provides a sense of the form of the
								falls just before Euro-American settlement. The plat shows the five islands at the falls, numerous paths
								running to and from the falls, and the course of Bassett Creek, which today is buried underground and
								part
								of the Minneapolis sewer system. The plat is also interesting for what it does not show: the first
								attempts
								by Euro-American colonizers to control the river and the falls. The U.S. Army sawmill and gristmill,
								which
								had been built on the west bank in 1821, and the sawmill and dam built by Franklin Steele on the east
								bank
								of the falls in 1848 are represented in their approximate locations based on historical descriptions of
								the
								mills.<sup>31</sup>

								By the 1850s, speculators and investors were eyeing the dense northern forests of Minnesota and its rich
								resources for the lumber industry. In a series of treaties in 1854 and 1855, the Anishinaabe ceded the
								majority of their northern lands in exchange for guaranteed reservations. The tribes hoped that by
								moving to
								a reservation they would no longer be harassed and exploited by white settlers. Again, the treaties
								included
								provisions that allowed the Anishinaabe to hunt and use the ceded lands as they had always done. For 140
								years those rights were disregarded until the Anishinaabe won a series of court cases in the
								1990s.<sup>32</sup>
							</p>
							<p>
								In 1855, the Ho-Chunk gave up their reservation in northern Minnesota for a new reservation on lands
								around
								the Blue Earth River (outside of this map’s boundaries). The land around Blue Earth were considered some
								of
								the best farmland in the Minnesota territory. White settlers were incensed at the decision and had to be
								forcibly removed from the lands of the new reservation. The Ho-Chunk attempted to live peaceably with
								their
								white neighbors but resentment festered. In 1863, at the urging of white residents in Blue Earth, the
								Ho-Chunk were included in the federal government orders removing the Dakota from Minnesota. More than
								550
								Ho-Chunk died in the forced removal to South Dakota.<sup>33</sup>

								sustain themselves. In August of 1862, feeling they had no other choice, some members of the Dakota
								tribes
								organized for war. For a few days in August the Dakota attacked farmsteads and settlements, but the U.S.
								Army quickly overran the warriors and took them captive. The men were imprisoned in Mankato while the
								rest
								of the Dakota were rounded up and placed in a concentration camp below Fort Snelling near Bdóte. 303 men
								were sentenced to death. President Lincoln approved the executions of 38 of those sentenced. In December
								of
								1862 the largest mass hanging in U.S. history occurred in Mankato, Minnesota when 38 Dakota men were
								hung on
								a single, massive scaffold.<sup>35</sup>
							</p>
							<p>
								In 1863, the U.S. government nullified all treaties previously made with the Dakota and forced the
								Dakota to
								give up all their land in Minnesota. The Dakota were marched to the Crow Creek reservation in South
								Dakota.
								Over 500 Dakota died in the concentration camp at Fort Snelling and on the march.<sup>36</sup>

								The forced removal of the Dakota from Minnesota was not disconnected from the industrial development of
								St.
								Anthony Falls. Indigenous peoples needed to be removed from the land to make the land “public.” This
								public
								land could then be surveyed and parceled out to individual buyers. Private property allowed the wealth
								from
								resources like timber or grain to be easily commodified. Private property also allowed individuals to
								claim
								the right to harness and channel the power of the Mississippi at St. Anthony Falls.

								as
								the properties of the multiple saw and flour mills crowding the river bank. The map also shows the
								proposed
								line of the St. Anthony Falls Tunnel.
							</p>
							<p>
								The tunnel was designed to create a tailrace for a new mill on Nicollet Island. During construction,
								water
								started leaking into the tunnel and eroded the soft sandstone bedrock. The tunnel quickly collapsed and
								formed a giant whirlpool which threatened to destroy the entirety of St. Anthony Falls.<sup>37</sup> The
								U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in one of their first projects, were brought in to help. It took 5 years
								for
								the Corps to stabilize the falls by building a massive concrete curtain wall around the hole. This
								stopped
								all further erosion and disintegration. The Corps also filled the tunnel and eroded cavities with 22,329
								cubic yards of gravel to stabilize the bedrock.<sup>38</sup> These efforts succeeded at preserving the
								falls

								This map of Minneapolis and St. Anthony Falls from 1872 shows how quickly the culture of the Dakota was
								erased from the landscape of Owámni to create St. Anthony Falls. The map represents the islands at the
								falls, the river, and Bassett Creek with solid lines marking out a clear boundary between water and
								land.
								The land is left blank and is treated as an abstract surface on which to the City of Minneapolis is
								being
								constructed. The grid of the city extends infinitely far across the landscape irrespective of any
								natural
								features or topography. At the same time the river is being channelized to power the mills and bridged
								to
								connect the city to capitalist commodity networks. The map also shows the multiple railroad companies
								coming
								into Minneapolis, evidence of the new transcontinental transportation network being constructed across
								the
								United States in the late 19th-century.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Public Land Survey was the basis of the railroad companies’ ability to build their vast networks. To
								spur the development of railroads, the U.S. government made extensive land grants to the railroad
								companies
								after the end of the Civil War. Essentially, the federal government gave the railroad companies the
								title to
								large tracts of what was once Indigenous land for the railroads to sell or lease. By selling this gifted
								land, the railroads were able to raise the funds necessary to construct their transcontinental
								networks.<sup>40</sup>
							</p>
							<p>
								By 1872 St. Anthony Falls largely resembled its contemporary form and the railroads were beginning to
								make
								their marks in the landscape. To create a well-graded bed for the tracks running through the city, the
								railroads dug out and leveled large portions of the land St. Paul and Minneapolis were being built upon.
								The
								Wakán Tipi cave, near to the first site of the falls 12,000 years ago and sacred to the Dakota, was
								partially destroyed when the cliffs that surrounded it were dynamited to create a wide enough bed for
								tracks
								to run alongside the Mississippi.<sup>41</sup>

								The map on the right shows the network of railroads crossing Minnesota at the end of the 19th-century.
								Thanks to the land grants made to the railroads by the federal government, the western plains were
								quickly
								incorporated into an industrial food system that had its center in Minneapolis and St. Anthony Falls. As
								white settlers moved into the lands stolen from the Indigenous peoples in the western United States,
								wheat
								became one of the biggest cash crops of the region. St. Anthony Falls provided the power for numerous
								flour
								mills and the railroads transported the grain to the mills. Companies like Northern Pacific and Great
								Northern grew into national monopolies by transporting grain, commodities, and people across the
								continent.
								By 1880, Minneapolis was leading the nation in flour production.<sup>42</sup> Railroads came into
								Minneapolis from the west and deposited their wheat at the falls, then, loaded with flour, headed east
								to
								deliver their goods to the growing eastern cities. St. Anthony Falls became the center of industrial
								production for the region, connected to the coasts of the United States through the railroads and to the
								south through the Mississippi.

								An atlas produced by the Minneapolis Real Estate Board in 1914 shows the heyday of flour production in
								Minneapolis. The railroads traveled directly to St. Anthony Falls after entering the city. Depots and
								rail
								yards lined the river’s edge and dominated the landscape. This map also represents the early stages of
								hydroelectric power in Minneapolis, which was made possible by the Lower Dam constructed downstream in
								1897.
								The Lower Dam powered the Twin Cities Street Car Power Station and ran the trolleys that provided public
								transit throughout Minneapolis until the middle of the 20th-century. The Lower Dam also permanently
								inundated the rapids that had provided habitat for many species of fish at the base of the
								Falls.<sup>43</sup> Eagles no
								longer flew at Owámni.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, the industrialization of St. Anthony Falls funded a development boom in Minneapolis. Limestone
								was
								quarried from Spirit Island to build the flour mills and homes of the grain barons. The grid of the city
								extended further and further into the landscape. The falls itself become more rigidly defined. Concrete
								embankments and walls allowed its power to be controlled and directed by commercial
								industry.<sup>44</sup>
							</p>
							<p>
								By 1914 much of the infrastructure still in existence today at St. Anthony Falls had been built. The
								only
								differences between the 1914 form of the falls and that of today are the lack of the upper and lower
								locks
								at the falls and the span of I-35W over the river. These changes would come as Minneapolis’ economy
								shifted
								away from flour milling and railroads to a service-based economy and transportation primarily through
								automobiles.<sup>45</sup>

								After 1916, flour milling in Minneapolis began to decline as a result of tariff acts passed by the U.S.
								Congress. These acts allowed millers to import Canadian grain duty free if they then exported the flour.
								This shifted the economic center of flour milling to the Great Lakes where wheat from Canada could be
								shipped on large barges.<sup>46</sup>
							</p>
							<p>
								As the power of the railroads waned along with flour milling at St. Anthony Falls, business and civic
								leaders pushed to make Minneapolis the head of navigation on the Mississippi. St. Paul, MN had always
								been
								the natural head of navigation on the Mississippi because upstream from St. Paul the river was too
								narrow
								and filled with rapids to allow for barge transit. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th-centuries the
								Army Corps of Engineers had been building locks and dams along the Mississippi, as well as dredging ever
								expanding shipping channels to aid transportation on the river. In 1930, the Corps began digging a
								9-foot
								navigation channel along the majority of the Mississippi to improve the efficiency and cost of riverine
								transportation to the Midwest. Not wanting to miss out on this shipping boom, in 1937, Minneapolis
								successfully lobbied for federal funding to enact the Upper Minneapolis Harbor Development project. To
								achieve a channel deep and wide enough for barge traffic to reach Minneapolis, a series of locks and
								dams
								had to be built between Minneapolis and St. Paul. In 1956 the Lower St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam was
								completed and in 1963 the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock was completed.<sup>47</sup>
							</p>
							<p>
								The WPA atlas from 1940 shows Minneapolis and St. Anthony Falls at a time when flour milling and the
								railroads have lost their economic power and a new form of city is emerging. The railroads were still
								using
								the bridges they had constructed in the 19th-century to travel though the city, but the depots and rail
								yards had disappeared: trains no longer stopped in downtown Minneapolis. Numerous city streets now
								bridged
								the river, connecting outer neighborhoods and the suburbs to the city center by automobile. What were
								once
								large property holdings by the mills and railroad companies were being parceled off and developed for
								private residence or light industry. In 1940 there were more bridges crossing the Mississippi in
								Minneapolis
								than currently do today.

								In Minneapolis, a new kind of city has been building itself around St. Anthony Falls, one that is
								focused on
								mixed-use development, recreational access to the river, and the fostering of cultural and tourist
								attractions. In the 1980s, planning boards and advocacy groups began working together to imagine a
								future
								for St. Anthony Falls in which the city and its residents were reconnected with the Mississippi. The
								Minnesota Pollution Control Agency worked to assess and clean up many polluted sites. The City Council
								and
								the St. Anthony Falls Heritage Board led the changing priorities in riverfront development. Finally, the
								Minneapolis Parks Board turned sites like Boom Island into public parks with access to the river front
								and
								added miles of pedestrian trails along the river. The turning point for all these efforts was the
								opening of
								the Stone Arch Bridge (formerly used by the Great Northern Railroad) as a pedestrian bridge which
								crosses
								the river right below St. Anthony Falls.<sup>50</sup> Now, with the closing of the Upper St. Anthony
								Falls
								Lock and Dam, the question of who will determine the future of the falls, river, and city is once again
								open
								for dispute.
							</p>
							<p>
								The contemporary section maps of Minneapolis and St. Anthony Falls are interesting for their detailed
								representation of property boundaries and ownership. The development of St. Anthony Falls since European
								colonization has been a process of parceling and fragmentation. Capital and private property have
								allowed
								the development of an industrial and post-industrial Minneapolis with its attendant wealth and
								population
								size. But it has also separated the river from the land and broken up the land along the river. The
								question
								of ownership is continually reoccurring at the falls and the fragmentation of the landscape makes it
								difficult to envision new forms of ownership at any point along the river or in the landscape. In
								response,
								this research began to investigate the possibility of envisioning new forms of property at Owámni/St.
								Anthony Falls that reconnected the river to itself and to the land.

								Starting with the Dakota understanding of the river as a living relative, this research proposed an
								alternative form of property boundary based in the inherent agency of the river to determine its future.
								At
								the scale of Mni Sóta Makoce, the watershed of the Mississippi provides the inspiration. Instead of a
								property mapping system which draws indiscriminate grids across the landscape, the proposed system seeks
								to
								follow the rhizomatic course of the river and maintain the wholeness of the watershed. This will be the
								river’s property. Around the river’s property will be the land available for human determination and
								use.
								This speculative mapping seeks to radically disrupt the dominant systems of ownership and zoning which
								continually prohibit the return to a relational understanding of land and water which was once Mni Sóta
								Makoce.
							</p>
							<p>
								The intention of the research, through breaking up the current forms of property ownership, is to
								establish
								a more flexible and adaptive system which will allow the plants, people, and animals of Mni Sóta Makoce
								to
								adjust to and mitigate the environmental changes caused by Global Warming.

								At the scale of Owámni, this research does not attempt to answer the question of what future form the
								falls
								should take. It returns that question to the river. Using a hydrologic analysis of the surrounding
								landscape, a new zone of property along the river’s edge has been drawn. This is the river’s property,
								returned to the river. The flow of water and shifting sediment will determine the future of the falls.
								The
								city’s edge is now broken and fragmented, though bridges remain to span the river. The disruption caused
								by
								this speculative mapping creates new opportunities to envision an urban center that recognizes the river
								as
								a relative with agency and choice. From this, a new form of city can emerge that lives in relation with
								Owámni but not in control of it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Minneapolis will have to become more flexible as climate change increases the risk of flooding by the
								Mississippi. By imagining the city as living in dynamic kinship with the river, the question of
								ownership is
								no longer the dominant one. The question to be answered now is how the city will relate and adapt to its
								equal: the shifting, changing river.
